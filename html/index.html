			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Poison frogs are very interesting creatures indeed. They're known for their bright and vibrant colors that look beautiful. However, if you try to touch this frog, yuo could die in seconds!!! Predators have learned to stay away from these frogs, so some frogs copy the look of the poison frogs to make predators stay away from them too.</p>

			<h2>Habitat</h2>
			<p>Most species of poisonious frogs are found in rainforests in locations such as Central and South America. These frogs, like most frogs, prefer a wet and dark location to live in, so their skin can stay moisturized at all times.</p>

			<h2>Diet</h2>
			<p>Poison frogs generally eat ants and termite that can be found on the forest floors. It is believed that the frogs get their poisonious skin from eating these bugs, which touch and eat poisonious plants, which the frog then secretes off it's skin as oils. Frogs that are fed crickets and the like in captivity are not poisonious, which is why this theory is believed.</p>
